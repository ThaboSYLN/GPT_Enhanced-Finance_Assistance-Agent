Stablecoins are pegged to real-world assets, such as the U.S. dollar, and therefore fluctuate much less than other crypto assets like bitcoin. Campos Neto has previously said that the rising demand for stablecoins in Brazil was largely tied to tax evasion or illicit activities.

According to the Federal Reserve's latest data from the end of 2022, the number of millionaire households in the U.S. is rising \u2013 and it's not just inflation making the numbers look bigger. Even when adjusting for inflation, the percentage of households with a net worth of at least $1 million surged from 2019 to 2022 after being relatively flat for nearly two decades.

Motley Fool \u2022 5 hours ago      Expert Finds Trump's Tax Proposal Drains Money From 95% Of Households And Funnels It To The Top 5%, Widening Wealth Gap Former President Donald Trump's proposed tax plan has stirred up fresh controversy. A new analysis shows that it could provide substantial tax cuts for the nation\u2019s wealthiest while burdening the rest with tax increases by 2026. According to a recent Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) report, the top 1% of earners could enjoy an average tax cut of over $36,300. In comparison, the next 4% would see cuts averaging $7,200. Meanwhile, 95% of Americans could face tax hikes ranging from   Benzinga \u2022 22 hours ago      DJT stock extends massive rally as election odds shift in Donald Trump's favor Over the weekend, both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory,   Yahoo Finance \u2022 20 hours ago   DJT      DJTWW          Daily Spotlight: Inflation Challenges Remain, but Fed Focus Shifts Two recent inflation reports indicated that overall pricing pressures continue their downward trek. But both also confirmed that inflation remains above the Fed's 2.0% target. Let's take a deeper dive into the Consumer Price Index (CPI). According to the latest CPI report, the overall inflation rate in September of 2.4% was lower than the prior month's 2.5%. That good news was offset a bit by a higher reading in the monthly core CPI rate, which excludes the impact of food and energy and rose 3.3% in the past year (up from 3.2% a month ago). What's propping up core CPI? Transportation Services (+8.5% YOY) and Shelter (+4.7%), which have prices that don't typically fall sharply.  In contrast, prices for Gasoline and New and Used Cars are actually lower year over year. The other inflation report was the Producer Price Index (PPI). The PPI measures pricing trends farther up the supply chain, at the manufacturing level. Here, we also saw a decline in the rate of inflation.

What's propping up core CPI? Transportation Services (+8.5% YOY) and Shelter (+4.7%), which have prices that don't typically fall sharply.  In contrast, prices for Gasoline and New and Used Cars are actually lower year over year. The other inflation report was the Producer Price Index (PPI). The PPI measures pricing trends farther up the supply chain, at the manufacturing level. Here, we also saw a decline in the rate of inflation. For example, the PPI final demand annual rate through September was 1.8%, compared to 1.9% in August. We expect pricing pressures to continue easing as the housing market cools, supplies of new vehicles are replenished, and the price of oil stays below $90 per barrel (current price is around $74). The Federal Reserve lifted the feds fund rate from 0.0% to above 5.25% in 2022-2023, and those rate hikes evidently did their part in reducing inflationary pressures. The U.S. central bank shifted its policy toward lower rates in September, and we expect the Fed to continue to reduce the cost of money in 2H24 and 1H25, as its concern shifts toward economic growth. We expect a second rate cut at the Fed's meeting right after the U.S. presidential election.   Argus Research \u2022 1 hour ago   GEHC          Should You Buy Palantir Stock?
